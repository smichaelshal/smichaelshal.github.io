I am Michael and I am interested in technology, especially in the low-level world, kernel, processor architecture and networks. I enjoy exploring topics in depth in the worlds of hardware and software, I love development with challenging design, and most of all I love understanding how things work behind the scenes, and learning about complex systems.
